				<p style="padding-left: 17px;">Welcome to the Digital IPS (International Patient Summary) Portal. WA Verify is a free tool that can be used to access and share your digital records via SMART Health Link (SHLink). Enter a few details to generate a QR Code to access your records. If you would like to share your records, you may use either the electronic or a printed version of the QR Code you’ll get from the system. We recommend waiting 3-7 days for any new vaccination dose to show up in the Immunization Registry before generating a new SHLink.</p>

				<p style="padding-left: 17px;">People within a family may have multiple verification records associated with a single phone number or email address, enter each digital verification record request separately.</p>

				<p style="padding-left: 17px;">The system provides a digital copy of state records. If you received your vaccinations from a federal agency (Department of Defense, Indian Health Services, or Veterans Affairs), you will need to contact those agencies for assistance.</p>
