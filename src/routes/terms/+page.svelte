<h1><strong>Terms and Conditions</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated: 2025-12-12</strong></p>
<p>These Terms of Use (“Terms”) apply to your use of <strong>WA Health Summary</strong> (“the Application”). By using the Application, you agree to these Terms.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>1. HIPAA Context</strong></h2>
<p>The Application is designed to help <strong>you</strong>, the patient, access your own health information. In most cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We act as a <strong>patient-directed application</strong>, not as a HIPAA Covered Entity or Business Associate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your healthcare provider may treat your sharing of data with the Application as a <strong>HIPAA-permitted patient-directed disclosure</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health information you retrieve and store through the Application becomes your <strong>personal data</strong>, which you direct us to hold and process on your behalf.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If we ever operate as a HIPAA Business Associate—for example, with specific provider integrations—we will execute appropriate agreements and apply HIPAA safeguards.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>2. Use of the Application</strong></h2>
<p>The Application allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Authenticate with your healthcare provider using SMART on FHIR;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retrieve your electronic health record information;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Store data securely in an environment designed for handling Protected Health Information (PHI);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add personal health information;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generate International Patient Summary documents;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Share those documents using SMART Health Link QR codes or URLs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2><strong>3. Your Responsibilities Regarding PHI</strong></h2>
<p>By using the Application, you acknowledge that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You control who you share your IPS documents or SMART Health Links with;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are responsible for safeguarding QR codes and links you distribute;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may revoke access to some links, but recipients may still retain copies;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should not upload information belonging to another person unless legally authorized.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2><strong>4. Data Protection and Security</strong></h2>
<p>We implement HIPAA-aligned administrative, physical, and technical safeguards, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Encrypted storage and transmission;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access controls;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Audit logging;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secure server infrastructure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite these measures, no system is completely immune to breaches.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>5. No Medical Advice</strong></h2>
<p>The Application is not a healthcare provider and does not deliver medical advice. Data display and IPS generation are tools for your use and may not reflect your full medical history.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>6. Provider Data</strong></h2>
<p>We do not alter clinical data retrieved from EHR systems except where you explicitly make edits or additions.</p>
<p>We are not responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Omissions or errors in your provider’s data;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Differences between provider systems;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delays or failures in SMART on FHIR availability.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2><strong>7. Sharing Your Information</strong></h2>
<p>You are solely responsible for all disclosures you make using SMART Health Links, QR codes, or downloaded documents. Once shared, we cannot control how third parties use the data.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>8. Termination</strong></h2>
<p>We may suspend or terminate accounts for security concerns or violations of these Terms. You may discontinue use at any time.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>9. Governing Law</strong></h2>
<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of <strong>Washington State</strong>.</p>
