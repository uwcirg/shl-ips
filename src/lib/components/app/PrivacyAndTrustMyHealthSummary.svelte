  ${INSTANCE_CONFIG.title} requires users to create an account, as an important way of protecting your privacy. Like any computer account, it is important that you keep the account login information to yourself, and that you create a good, hard to guess, password and keep it confidential.

  Can you create an account with a fake email and fake information? Yes.

  But, the system will be much less valuable if you can’t use it to support your health. You can create multiple summaries of your data, and you can limit what data are contained in each of them, if you need different summaries for different purposes.

  Does using a fake email cause  any other problems for me? Maybe. We may periodically clean out seemingly unused accounts and we may first send you an email to remind you how to keep your account (if you use a fake email, you will not get that notification).

  What other privacy considerations are there? In order to use the system, you need to read and agree to the terms of use. There is a lot more information there about what we do and don’t do, and why we do or don’t do it.
