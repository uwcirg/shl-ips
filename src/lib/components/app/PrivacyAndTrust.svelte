  We want to demonstrate privacy, as well as the functions of {INSTANCE_CONFIG.title}, but do not use this system for real health data. Accounts are an important way of protecting your privacy.
</p>
<p class="info-paragraph">
  Can you create an account with a fake email and fake information? Yes.
</p>
<p class="info-paragraph">
  Does this create any problems for you? Maybe. We may periodically clean out seemingly unused accounts and we may first send you an email to remind you how to keep your account (if you use a fake email, you will not get that notification).
</p>
<p class="info-paragraph">
  What other privacy considerations are there? In order to use the system, you need to read and agree to the terms of use. There is a lot more information there about what we do and don’t do, and why we do or don’t do it.
</p>
<p class="info-paragraph">
  What about my health data? In this demo system, the terms of use say that you can not use the system for real health data. We can’t control what you enter into the parts of the system that allow you to enter health data, but we do not guarantee that this demonstration system will be available, or that the data will be preserved through system upgrades or fixes.
